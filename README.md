Data Science Internship Project: Task-01
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive pipeline of functions to automate essential data processing steps. This includes:

Data loading
Data cleaning
Handling missing values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Outlier detection
The pipeline was applied to three different classification datasets from Kaggle. Additionally, I implemented and evaluated a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model on each dataset to assess their classification performance.

This project showcases my hands-on learning experience and practical application of data science techniques during my internship.
